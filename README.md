# I'm a Rockstar Programmer!

This repository contains songs in the [Rockstar](
https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar/blob/master/spec.md)
programming language. These power ballads are all works in progress,
until I get a record deal.

## Solo

My first song, [`solo.rock`](solo.rock) is a rockstar's lament: what
good is a city without a brothel?? You tell me, friend. You tell me.

The program prints the integers in sequence from 10 to 1. In Python,
it would read

``` python
the_city = 185
the_brothel = 175
while the_brothel != the_city:
    print(the_city - the_brothel)
    the_brothel += 1
```
